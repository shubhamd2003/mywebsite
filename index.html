        <p class="section-subtag text-small">Computers can do amazing things, from basic laptops capable of simple word processing and spreadsheet functions to incredibly complex supercomputers completing millions of financial transactions a day and controlling the infrastructure that makes modern life possible. But no computer can do anything until a computer programmer tells it to behave in specific ways. That’s what computer programming is all about.
         At its most basic, computer programming is little more than a set of instructions to facilitate specific actions. Based on the requirements or purposes of these instructions, computer programming can be as simple as adding two numbers. It can also be as complex as reading data from temperature sensors to adjust a thermostat, sorting data to complete intricate scheduling or critical reports or taking players through multi-layered worlds and challenges in games.computer programming is a collaborative process, with a variety of programmers contributing during the development of a piece of software. Some of that development can last decades. For software like Microsoft Word released in 1983, for instance, programmers have been tweaking and improving it for years..</p>

        <p class="sectiontag text-big">Development of Coding.</p>
        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">While a programmer simply has to think and build a logical framework of decisions for the application, a coder has to implement that logic with a particular programming language in a standard, efficient way.

            A coder has to become familiar with code syntax and be up-to-date with newer and recommend ways of writing code.
            
            A coder has to be good at technical tasks like testing, debugging, and so on.
            
            Code is simply the language a machine understands. To implement an application, you have to take the set of instructions created by a programmer and make it understandable by the machine. That is the act of coding.
            
            Using the same example of email validation and storage, let's implement that logic in JavaScript code:As you can see from the above extensive definition, development is bigger than just programming and coding. It’s all about creating a solution to a real life problem by building an application which solves that problem, maintaining that application, marketing it, researching mays to optimize it, and so on.The invention of computers has brought a lot of changes in people’s lives and has helped in fulfilling people’s dreams. A computer is used in various organisations, schools, institutions, offices, etc. It can be used to store important information with high protection and can also be used to send and receive messages, make calculations, develop software, send and receive emails, etc.

        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">In this ever-changing modern world, it has become really hard to live without computers. Everything has become digitalised, and computers have made work easier and smoother. All the information which might get missed by humans is stored in the computer. Read the following samples for more information on computers.A computer is an electronic device that was discovered by Charles Babbage. He is known as the father of computers. There are various parts to a computer. The four major parts of a computer are the mouse, keyboard, monitor and CPU. With computers, we can send and receive messages through emails and save important information. It helps to store and modify data. Nowadays, computers are used in schools, banks, offices, etc., and it is now impossible to survive without computers. In order to run any organisation, institution, or any other office, a computer is a must. Computers have made life easier for people of different age groups.The computer is a remarkable piece of science that man has created to help humanity. Computers are in charge of today’s reality, and they have unquestionably altered people’s lifestyles and the condition of developing countries.</p>
